    - Uses a text-to-speech system called [MaryTTS](http://mary.dfki.de/) to synthesize speech from text
    - Due to the size of MaryTTS, it is not there by default and requires installation into the Minecraft instance directory as described [here](https://wiki.vexatos.com/wiki:computronics:mary).

  * ADDED: Noise Card!
    - An upgraded Beep Card with slightly different syntax
    - Can play square waves, sine waves, triangle waves and sawtooth waves!

    - Supports frequency modulation, amplitude modulation, general volume changes, wave type changes, certain types of noise generation, frequency changes and ADSR on 8 channels, allowing for highly customizable sound synthesis!
    - Works on an instruction-based system; instructions are added to a queue and processed when wanted.
  * ADDED: Support for TIS-3D!
    - Added a Colorful Module to display any colour you want, akin to a Colorful Lamp.

    - Added a Server Self-Destructor in case you don't need your servers anymore.
    - Added a Rack Capacitor which is a Capacitor you can put into a Rack. Ingenious. It also provides a component that gives you the amount of energy stored in that capacitor.
    - Added a Switch Board providing four switches to manually and automatically activate and deactivate. Fires an event whenever a switch is flipped, too.

      - Allows full control over the coordinates set (if allowed in the EnderIO config file) as well as telepad activation
    - Added support for the new Weather Obelisk
      - Allows control over the weather, provided the Obelisk has the correct items.
    - The Capacitor Bank now provides two additional functions, `getAverageInputPerTick()` and `getAverageOutputPerTick()`
      - This allows you to monitor input and output of your energy network separately
    - Now you can get and set the range of Vacuum Chests
    - Added `getProgress()` to most machines with progress
  * CHANGED: Sangar made beep card and noise card textures a lot less boring. He also made the sound card texture to match them. Thanks a lot!

    - Can now be paired to up to 32 receivers, just like the controller box
    - Allows individually querying the aspect of each paired controller
    - Sends an `aspect_changed` event containing the controller's name and new aspect.
    - Controllers must be referenced by their name, meaning you have to name all your signals using Signal Labels

    - Connects audio players (like Tape Drives) to audio receivers (Like Speakers)
    - If you connect one to a Tape Drive, it will stop playing itself and instead send the sound across the cables.
    - Can be coloured. When coloured, they won't connect to cables with a different colour and won't connect to coloured audio senders/receivers with a different colour.

    - Note: In case you change the colour of a block that existed in the world before you updated, it might not properly save the colour (this should only happen very rarely so you probably will not be affected at all). In this case just break and re-place the block!

  * ADDED: Armourer's Workshop integration!
    - Now you can change rotation of body parts of mannequins using ComputerCraft or OpenComputers.

    - Right click to open the customer GUI
      - Here you can select the ticket you would like to print and print tickets
    - Shift-right click with an empty hand

    - MultiPeripheral system can now recognize every ComputerCraft peripheral!
      - This can be disabled in the config
    - MultiPeripheral system is now almost always being recognized by ComputerCraft
      - This means that the basic behaviour of ComputerCraft's peripheral handling changed:
        - Previously ComputerCraft, when trying to access a peripheral and multiple mods are adding peripherals to the same block, would choose the peripheral that has been registered first
        - Now all Peripherals on the same block are merged into a single one using the MultiPeripheral system, meaning that there won't be peripheral conflicts anymore
      - This can be reverted to default behaviour in the config
    - Added a config option to disable OpenPeripheral integration

    - Beep Card: Provides beep(); same as computer.beep(), just takes a table with frequency-duration pairs, allows playing up to 8 different sounds at once. See [this example implementation](https://github.com/OpenPrograms/Vexatos-Programs/blob/master/song/song.lua)
  * ADDED: OpenPeripheral integration:
    - Now OpenPeripheral peripherals aren't ignored anymore if Computronics is present
  * ADDED: More BuildCraft integration
